# DBaaS

A small DBaaS application developed to test/leverage Docker functionalities.

Currently only MongoDB is implemented.

Docker API is not used due to limited functionalities (I am scared, may be in future I will try them :P)
Hence used Paramiko to get the work done.

MongoDB docker image is builded from local repo (as my brother doesn't have good internet connection and he is going to submit this for his final year project).

--- The directory and documentation now is a mess, will clear up soon :) ----
